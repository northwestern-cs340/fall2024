## Course books

There is **one** required book for the class: **[Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, by Kurose and Ross](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/index.html)**. It's currently in it's 8th edition, but I suggest you save some money by buying a used 7th or 6th edition. Here is the [table of contents for the 8th edition](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/Kurose_Ross_TOC_8E.pdf), which might be helpful when trying to translate section numbers to your edition.

## Other reference books

**[TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols (2nd Edition), by Fall and Stevens.](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Protocols-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321336313)** is a good reference for _TCP, IP, DNS, etc._. There is also a [free online version of the 1st edition](https://www.isi.edu/~hussain/TEACH/Spring2014/notes/Steven00a.pdf), which is probably all you'll need.

## Pair work

Projects may be done in paris (2 people) or individually. Groups of three are **NOT** allowed. But you can switch your partner for different projects.

Both students in a pair must understand how all of their code works. Please find a teammate and join one of the student groups on Canvas. Feel free to use Canvas discussion to find partner.

## Late policy

Any assignment may be turned in up to two days late, with **a 10 percentage point deduction per late day**. In rare circumstances, the instructor may cancel this policy for particular assignments, so please pay attention to the course announcements.

## Academic Integrity

Students in this course are required to comply with the policies found in the booklet, _"Academic Integrity at Northwestern University: A Basic Guide"_. All papers submitted for credit in this course must be submitted electronically unless otherwise instructed by the professor. Your written work may be tested for plagiarized content. For details regarding academic integrity at Northwestern or to download the guide, visit: https://www.northwestern.edu/provost/policies/academic-integrity/index.html

Northwestern University is committed to providing the most accessible learning environment as possible for students with disabilities. Should you anticipate or experience disability-related barriers in the academic setting, please contact AccessibleNU to move forward with the university's established accommodation process (e: accessiblenu@northwestern.edu; p: 847-467-5530). If you already have established accommodations with AccessibleNU, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably within the first two weeks of the term, so we can work together to implement your disability accommodations.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

## Prohibition of Recording of Class Sessions by Students

Unauthorized student recording of classroom or other academic activities (including advising sessions or office hours) is prohibited. Unauthorized recording is unethical and may also be a violation of University policy and state law. Students requesting the use of assistive technology as an accommodation should contact [AccessibleNU](https://www.northwestern.edu/accessiblenu/). Unauthorized use of classroom recordings - including distributing or posting them - is also prohibited. Under the University's [Copyright Policy](https://www.invo.northwestern.edu/invention-disclosure/policies-forms/copyright-policy/), faculty own the copyright to instructional materials - including those resources created specifically for the purposes of instruction, such as syllabi, lectures and lecture notes, and presentations.
